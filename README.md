## 🚀 **Project Aim**
- The goal of this project is to **help farmers and agricultural experts** detect plant diseases early by analyzing images of infected plants.
- The model classifies diseases by identifying **visual patterns** using **deep learning**.

---

## 🛠️ **Model Training Process**

### 🔹 **# Dataset Collection**
- The dataset consists of **images of plants with various diseases**.
- Each image is labeled with its corresponding disease class.

### 🔹 **# Model Development**
1. The dataset is used to **train a deep learning model**.
2. The model learns to identify disease-specific visual features, such as:
   - 🍃 **Leaf discoloration**
   - 🍂 **Spots or lesions**
   - 🌿 **Irregular shapes or patterns**
3. The trained model (`abhi.h5`) can then **predict the disease in new plant images** by comparing them with the learned features.

## 🌾 **Practical Use of the Project**

### 🔹 **# For Farmers**
- This project is designed for farmers to **identify crop pathogens early**.
- Farmers can capture images of affected plants and use the tool to detect the specific disease.

### 🔹 **# Early Detection Helps In:**
- ✅ **Preventing the spread** of the disease to other crops.
- ✅ Taking timely action with **appropriate treatments**.
- ✅ **Reducing crop loss** and improving overall yield quality.

### 🔹 **# For Agricultural Research**
- The project can be used by **agricultural experts** to study the spread of plant diseases.
- It can aid in **research and development** of new treatments and preventive measures.

## 💡 **Note**
- The **model `abhi.h5`** will automatically save to the **`models/`** folder after training.
- The code supports both:
   - **Image folders**.
   - **ZIP files** containing images (using the `zipfile` Python library for extraction).

## 📊 **Dataset Information**
- The project uses the **PlantVillage dataset**, which contains images of plant leaves with various diseases.
